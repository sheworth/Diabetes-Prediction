Introduction:
Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and intervention are crucial for managing diabetes and preventing severe complications. This project aims to build a predictive model using supervised learning techniques to identify individuals at risk of developing diabetes.

Dataset:
The dataset used for this project is the PIMA Indians Diabetes Database. It includes several medical predictor variables and one target variable indicating whether the patient has diabetes.
Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
Age: Age (years)
Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)

Usage:
-Data Preprocessing:
-Clean the dataset
-Handle missing values
-Feature scaling
-Model Training:
-I train two machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors)
-Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics

Model Evaluation:
I used metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and ROC-AUC

Prediction:
I used the trained model to make predictions on new data

Modeling:
The following models were explored and tuned to achieve the best performance:
Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors

Results
The final model's performance is summarized below:
-Accuracy: 0.72
-Precision: 0.76
-Recall: 0.84
-F1 Score: 0.80
-ROC-AUC: 0.75

The Logistic Regression Classifier yielded the best performance between the tested models.
